Hi all! We are group of Tech Nubys from GT Bootcamp for the period of Sept 2022 - March 2023. Our team consists of 
* Anna de Jesus
* Nasra Ahmed 
* Kokila Janarthanan 
* Jonathan Michel


### Overview
We chose to do a project on Covid Layoff's from a period of 2020 - 2022. 
Our main motivation for further analyzing the layoffs during covid came from the effect that it had personally on each of our families. We felt it would be interesting to compare how each country was affected because of covid as we are all originally from other countries.  

Our mission was to create a Full Stack application using the core technologies we learned so far.
We dived into the project with knowledge adquired so far in our bootcamp and with an open mind to explore new technologies!

### Project Structure:

### Data and Data Delivery 
* A dataset that contains at least 100 unique records
* SQLite database to house the data
* The project is powered by a Python Flask Api and includes professional-level use of HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite

### Back End
* Javascript/CSS
* Showcase three data visualizations ran without error
* Leaflet/Plotly

### Visualizations
* Multiple user-driven interactions are included on the final page - dropdowns/zoom feature
* Credentials page to gather user information

### Dataset
The Data present in kaggle.com was collected by Roger Lee and put in a .CSV file format. We would like to give that person the credit for simplifying the collection of the data processed for us. 

Our project was powered by utilization of python Flask API and SQLite to house our database. The webpage created showcases data visualiations which include user-driven interactions.

Furthermore, we dived in to create a credentials page. This was a new learning curve for us....

### How to run the App
#### Prequistes - Python Libraries
The following Python modules need to installed in machine the user is running our app on.
* flask
* flask_sqlalchemy
* flask_bootstrap
* flask_wtf
* wtforms
​
#### Terminal command
The terminal command to start the app is shown below:
    > python layoff_visualization.py
​
#### Browser Activity
* To view the visualization charts in a browser, open a browser(Chrome is preferred) and type "http://127.0.0.1:5000" and press 'enter' key
* enter your name, city, state, and country details and press submit. This will take you to Visualization Menu page
* In the menu page you have option to select Different visualizations to see and interact , to explore underlying Layoff data.


### Project Highlights
We feel our project stands out with the credentials page created in Python Flask API, the credentials stored in SQLite database and the output of allowing our user to choose between three of our interactive charts (bar, map and line graph).

### Pearls we found
We believe that having insight into the trends of the past in the industries shown in the dataset will help us to manage our future pandemics and/or crises in the workfield. As new aspiring job seekers, we hope to choose a field that will secure ourselves and our families in unforeseen circumstances.
